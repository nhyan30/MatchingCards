OBJECTIVE:
Guess your opponent's mystery character before they guess yours!

GAMEPLAY:

1. CHARACTER SELECTION
   - Select a character from the grid to be your mystery character
   - Your opponent (AI or another player) will do the same

2. ASKING QUESTIONS
   - Take turns asking Yes/No questions about the opponent's character
   - Use questions like ""Does your character have glasses?"" or ""Does your character have a hat?""
   - Navigate through questions using the arrow buttons
   - Press SEND to ask the current question

3. ELIMINATING CHARACTERS
   - Based on the answers, characters will be eliminated from your grid
   - Click on a character to cross them out manually if needed

4. MAKING A GUESS
   - When you think you know the opponent's character, press ""Do A Guess""
   - Click on the character you think is the mystery character
   - If correct, you win! If wrong, you lose!

MULTIPLAYER:
   - Host a game to create a room with a 6-digit code
   - Share the code with a friend on the same WiFi network
   - Join a game by entering the host's room code

TIPS:
   - Ask questions that eliminate the most characters
   - Pay attention to the opponent's questions for hints
   - Don't guess too early - make sure you're confident!";
